abstract={High temperature increases energy demand in ectotherms, limiting their physiological capability to cope with hypoxic events. The present study aimed to assess the metabolic tolerance of juvenile Nodipecten subnodosus scallops to acute hyperthermia combined with moderate hypoxia. A previous study showed that juveniles exhibited a high upper temperature limit (32 °C), but the responses of juveniles to combined hyperthermia and low dissolved oxygen are unknown. Scallops were exposed to control conditions (treatment C: 22 °C, ∼7.1 mg O2 L−1 or PO2 156.9 mmHg), acute hyperthermia under normoxia (treatment T: 30 °C, ∼6.0 mg O2 L−1 or PO2 150.9 mmHg) or acute hyperthermia plus hypoxia (treatment TH: 30 °C, ∼2.5 mg O2 L−1 or PO2 62.5 mmHg) for 18 h. In T, juveniles exhibited an enhanced oxygen consumption, together with a decrease in adenylate energy charge (AEC) and arginine phosphate (ArgP), and with no changes in metabolic enzyme activity in the muscle. In TH, scallops maintained similar AEC and ArgP levels in muscle as those observed in T treatment. This response occurred along with the accumulation of inosine monophosphate and hypoxanthine. Besides, reduced citrate synthase and pyruvate kinase activities, enhanced hexokinase activity, and a higher octopine dehydrogenase/lactate dehydrogenase ratio in the mantle indicated the onset of anaerobiosis in TH. These responses indicate that juvenile scallops showed tissue-specific compensatory responses regarding their energy balance under moderate hypoxia at high temperatures. Our results give an insight into the tolerance limit of this species to combined hyperthermia and hypoxia in its northern limit of distribution. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Hippocampus erectus inhabiting the shallow coastal waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico are naturally exposed to marked temperature variations occurring in different temporal scales. Under such heterogeneous conditions, a series of physiological and biochemical adjustments take place to restore and maintain homeostasis. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of H. erectus to increased temperature using transcriptome analysis based on RNA-Seq technology. Data was obtained from seahorses after 0.5-h exposure to combinations of different target temperatures (26 °C: control, and increased to 30 and 33 °C) and rates of thermal increase (abrupt: < 5 min; gradual: 1–1.5 °C every 3 h). The transcriptome of seahorses was assembled de novo using Trinity software to obtain 29,211 genes and 30,479 transcripts comprising 27,520,965 assembled bases. Seahorse exposure to both 30 and 33 °C triggered characteristic processes of the cellular stress response, regardless of the rate of thermal change. The transcriptomic profiles of H. erectus suggest an arrest of muscle development processes, the activation of heat shock proteins, and a switch to anaerobic metabolism within the first 0.5 h of exposure to target temperatures to ensure energy supply. Interestingly, apoptotic processes involving caspase were activated principally in gradual treatments, suggesting that prolonged exposure to even sublethal temperatures results in the accumulation of deleterious effects that may eventually terminate in cellular death. Results herein validate 30 °C and 33 °C as potential upper limits of thermal tolerance for H. erectus at the southernmost boundary of its geographic distribution. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Haliotis cracherodii is the only abalone species listed as critically endangered (IUCN Red List) and protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) since 2009. The population started decreasing in the mid-1980s throughout its biogeographical range due to the "withering syndrome"disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermoregulation of the black abalone, establishing its preferred temperature, locomotion displacement, and critical thermal maximum (CTMax). The preferred temperature (PT) was 13.8 °C. The theoretical temperature for optimal growth of the black abalone was 14.3 °C. The locomotion displacement in the gradient had an interval of 137 to 83 cm h-1. CTMax was evaluated, the first abalone detached from the substrate at a temperature of 25.4 °C and the last one at 31 °C; CTMax of 50% was calculated at 29.7 °C. These data will allow us to maintain and condition the black abalone in captivity with the final goal of producing seed for the restoration of disease-impacted populations on the Baja California Peninsula. ENSO events may also affect the survival of black abalone. We extrapolated the Thermal Safety Margin (TSM) = (28.8 - 18.31 °C) = 10.49 °C in weak ENSOs, but in stronger ENSO the TSM value diminishes to 3.17 °C suggesting that black abalone may be vulnerable to climate change. ©},

abstract={Crassostrea virginica was exposed to different light crude oil levels to assess the effect on transcriptomic response and metabolic rate. The exposure time was 21 days, and levels of 100 and 200 μg/L were used, including a control. The most significant difference among treatments was the overexpression of several genes associated with energy production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, immune system response, and inflammatory response. Also, a hydrocarbon concentration-related pattern was identified in ROS regulation, with a gene expression ratio near 1.8:1 between 200 and 100 μg/L treatments. Statistical analysis showed no interaction effect for metabolic rate; however, significant differences were found for oil concentration and time factors, with a higher oxygen consumption at 200 μg/L. Our findings provide novel information about the metabolic response of C. virginica during hydrocarbons exposure. In addition, our results point out which biological processes should be investigated as targets for searching bioindicators. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background. The Espiritu Santo archipelago is recognized for its high biodiversity as a national park. Studies carried out on soft-bottom mollusks are of the faunistic type, and little is known about the variations in their community structure. Objective. To know the composition and the spatial variation in the structure of the assemblages of soft-bottom mollusks of the archipelago and to describe the possible incidence of the type of substrate in their structuring. Methods. In the infralittoral zone, 66 sampling sites were distributed in nine locations. The mollusks were collected by autonomous diving using a 1 m-2metal frame and a nucleator to analyze of the sediment texture. The medium-grained sand substrate presented the highest distribution. The ecological indices of abundance, species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity (H'), and Pielou evenness index (J') were estimated. Results. 23,743 individuals were quantified, belonging to 102 species distributed in three classes, 17 orders, 39 families, and 70 genera. The bivalves were represented by 48 species, 9 orders, 17 families, and 39 genera. The gastropods by 52 species, 7 orders, 21 families and 30 genera, and the scaphopods by 1 species. Significant differences were found between localities for species richness and diversity but not for species equity. Conclusions. Spatial variations were observed in the structure of the mollusks assemblages in the archipelago, which could be due to the combined effect of the sediment texture and the presence of mangroves existing in some locations. © 2022 Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana.

abstract={Along the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico), abalone represents one of the most lucrative fisheries. As wild populations are currently depleted, abalone farm production aims to balance the decreasing populations with the increasing demand. The Mexican abalone aquaculture is almost entirely based on red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). However, the increasing frequency of extreme temperature events is hampering this activity. The use interspecific hybrids can potentially improve abalone culture, as species have differences in their thermal tolerance. Therefore, the hybrid progeny between H. rufescens (♀) and pink abalone H. corrugata (♂), a temperate and a warmer water abalone species, respectively, will naturally support higher temperature. To test this hypothesis, growth rate, mortality and metabolic rate of both pure (RR) and hybrid abalone (RP) were assessed under the H. rufescens’ optimum (18 °C) and thermally stressed (22 °C) conditions. To unveil the molecular pathways involved in the heat response, transcriptional profiling of both crosses was also investigated. At high temperature, we observed constrained growth and survival in RR while RP showed a significant increase in both rates, supporting the improved performance of the hybrid compared. These results match with the transcriptional profiling of hybrids showing higher expression of genes involved in growth and calcification, whereas in the pure red progeny, the transcriptional profile was mainly associated with the regulation of necroptosis process. Our results may contribute to propose new management plans to increase farm abalone production in Baja California. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Transcriptional regulation constitutes a rapid response of marine organisms facing stressful environmental conditions, such as the concomitant exposure to warming, ocean acidification and hypoxia under climate change. In previous studies, we investigated whole-organism physiological patterns and cellular metabolism in gill and muscle of the marine gastropod Haliotis fulgens in response to increasing temperature (18 °C to 32 °C at +3 °C per day) under hypoxia (50% air saturation), hypercapnia (1000 μatm pCO2) and both factors combined. Here, we report investigations of the molecular responses of H. fulgens to temperature and identify mechanisms concomitantly affected by hypoxia and hypercapnia. A de novo transcriptome assembly with subsequent quantitative PCR and correlation network analysis of genes involved in the molecular response were used to unravel the correlations between gene expression patterns under the different experimental conditions. The correlation networks identified a shift from the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (down-regulated) to the up-regulation of Hsp70 during warming under all experimental conditions in gill and muscle, indicating a strong up-regulation of damage prevention and repair systems at sustained cellular energy production. However, a higher capacity for anaerobic succinate production was evicted in gill, matching with observations from our previous studies indicating succinate accumulation in gill but not in muscle. Additionally, warming under hypoxia and hypercapnia kept mRNA levels of citrate synthase in both tissues unchanged following a similar pattern as muscle enzyme capacity from a previous study, suggesting an emphasis on maintaining rather than down-regulating mitochondrial activity. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The interaction between ocean warming, hypoxia and hypercapnia, suggested by climate projections, may push an organism earlier to the limits of its thermal tolerance window. In a previous study on juveniles of green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), combined exposure to hypoxia and hypercapnia during heat stress induced a lowered critical thermal maximum (CTmax), indicated by constrained oxygen consumption, muscular spams and loss of attachment. Thus, the present study investigated the cell physiology in foot muscle of H. fulgens juveniles exposed to acute warming (18 °C to 32 °C at +3 °C day−1) under hypoxia (50% air saturation) and hypercapnia (~1000 μatm PCO2), alone and in combination, to decipher the mechanisms leading to functional loss in this tissue. Under exposure to either hypoxia or hypercapnia, citrate synthase (CS) activity decreased with initial warming, in line with thermal compensation, but returned to control levels at 32 °C. The anaerobic enzymes lactate and tauropine dehydrogenase increased only under hypoxia at 32 °C. Under the combined treatment, CS overcame thermal compensation and remained stable overall, indicating active mitochondrial regulation under these conditions. Limited accumulation of anaerobic metabolites indicates unchanged mode of energy production. In all treatments, upregulation of Hsp70 mRNA was observed already at 30 °C. However, lack of evidence for Hsp70 protein accumulation provides only limited support to thermal denaturation of proteins. We conclude that under combined hypoxia and hypercapnia, metabolic depression allowed the H. fulgens musculature to retain an aerobic mode of metabolism in response to warming but may have contributed to functional loss. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={With ongoing climate change, rising ocean temperature is usually accompanied by falling oxygen levels (hypoxia) and increasing CO2 concentration (hypercapnia). Both drivers may impose constraints on physiological mechanisms that define thermal limits resulting in increased vulnerability towards warming in marine ectotherms. The present study aimed to detect differences in thermal tolerance by investigating the underlying metabolic responses in the green abalone (Haliotis fulgens) under conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia. Juvenile abalones were exposed to a temperature ramp (+ 3 °C day− 1) under hypoxia (50% air saturation) and hypercapnia (~ 1000 μatm pCO2), both individually and in combination. Impacts on energy metabolism were assessed by analyzing whole animal respiration rates and metabolic profiles of gills and hepatopancreas via 1H NMR spectroscopy. While hypercapnia had a minor impact on the results of the temperature treatment, hypoxia strongly increased the vulnerability to warming, indicated by respiration rates falling below values expected from an exponential increase and by the onset of anaerobic metabolism suggesting a downward shift of the upper critical temperature. Warming under combined hypoxia and hypercapnia elicited a severe change in metabolism involving a strong accumulation of amino acids, osmolytes and anaerobic end products at intermediate temperatures, followed by declining concentrations at warmer temperatures. This matched the limited capacity to increase metabolic rate, loss of attachment and mortality observed under these conditions suggesting a strong narrowing of the thermal window. In all cases, the accumulation of free amino acids identified proteins as a significant energy source during warming stress. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Changes in global mean sea surface temperature may have potential negative implications for natural and socioeconomic systems; however, measurements to predict trends in different regions have been limited and sometimes contradictory. In this study, an assessment of sea surface temperature change signals in the seas off Mexico is presented and compared to other regions and the world ocean, and to selected basin scale climatic indices of the North Pacific, the Atlantic and the tropical Pacific variability. We identified eight regions with different exposure to climate variability: In the Pacific, the west coast of the Baja California peninsula with mostly no trend, the Gulf of California with a modest cooling trend during the last 20 to 25 years, the oceanic area with the most intense recent cooling trend, the southern part showing an intense warming trend, and a band of no trend setting the boundary between North-Pacific and tropical-Pacific variability patterns; in the Atlantic, the northeast Gulf of Mexico shows cooling, while the western Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have been warming for more than three decades.

abstract={Summary: Population structure of the sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in the northeastern Pacific Ocean was determined using three approaches: geometric morphometrics (14 landmarks), mitochondrial DNA (fragment of COI gene), and nuclear DNA (four microsatellite loci). Samples came from the Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, offshore Oregon, and offshore the mid-Baja California Peninsula (at San Quintin). Differences in body shape were grouped in the samples from the north (Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska). A slight but significant population structure was also observed in allele frequencies of microsatellites, FST values, amova, and Bayesian individual assignment tests; however, analyses of population structure using mtDNA did not reveal any population differentiation. Differences in population structure detected by distinct approaches, in addition to the moderately high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity of the COI fragment, suggest recent and developing population differentiation in the sablefish. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.},

abstract={We assayed genetic variations at five microsatellite loci of dolphinfish captured at five sites in 2005 and eight sites in 2006 to detect genetic population structure of dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus in the Gulf of California and surrounding waters. Results show high genetic variation, similar to other pelagic fishes with large populations. Pairwise FST values and hierarchical AMOVA detected subtle but significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, mainly in samples of 2005 and some of 2006. However, Bayesian assignment analysis failed to detect genetic differentiation, which was also supported by the Mantel test and gene flow estimates among the sampled sites. This suggests that, despite the slight heterogeneity detected in this region, the dolphinfish forms a single panmictic population with high genetic variation and gene flow. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
