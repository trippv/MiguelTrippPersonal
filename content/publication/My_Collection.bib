abstract = {Summary: Population structure of the sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in the northeastern Pacific Ocean was determined using three approaches: geometric morphometrics (14 landmarks), mitochondrial DNA (fragment of COI gene), and nuclear DNA (four microsatellite loci). Samples came from the Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, offshore Oregon, and offshore the mid-Baja California Peninsula (at San Quintin). Differences in body shape were grouped in the samples from the north (Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska). A slight but significant population structure was also observed in allele frequencies of microsatellites, FST values, amova, and Bayesian individual assignment tests; however, analyses of population structure using mtDNA did not reveal any population differentiation. Differences in population structure detected by distinct approaches, in addition to the moderately high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity of the COI fragment, suggest recent and developing population differentiation in the sablefish. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation constitutes a rapid response of marine organisms facing stressful environmental conditions, such as the concomitant exposure to warming, ocean acidification and hypoxia under climate change. In previous studies, we investigated whole-organism physiological patterns and cellular metabolism in gill and muscle of the marine gastropod Haliotis fulgens in response to increasing temperature (18 °C to 32 °C at +3 °C per day) under hypoxia (50% air saturation), hypercapnia (1000 $\mu$atm pCO2) and both factors combined. Here, we report investigations of the molecular responses of H. fulgens to temperature and identify mechanisms concomitantly affected by hypoxia and hypercapnia. A de novo transcriptome assembly with subsequent quantitative PCR and correlation network analysis of genes involved in the molecular response were used to unravel the correlations between gene expression patterns under the different experimental conditions. The correlation networks identified a shift from the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (down-regulated) to the up-regulation of Hsp70 during warming under all experimental conditions in gill and muscle, indicating a strong up-regulation of damage prevention and repair systems at sustained cellular energy production. However, a higher capacity for anaerobic succinate production was evicted in gill, matching with observations from our previous studies indicating succinate accumulation in gill but not in muscle. Additionally, warming under hypoxia and hypercapnia kept mRNA levels of citrate synthase in both tissues unchanged following a similar pattern as muscle enzyme capacity from a previous study, suggesting an emphasis on maintaining rather than down-regulating mitochondrial activity.},

abstract = {We assayed genetic variations at five microsatellite loci of dolphinfish captured at five sites in 2005 and eight sites in 2006 to detect genetic population structure of dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus in the Gulf of California and surrounding waters. Results show high genetic variation, similar to other pelagic fishes with large populations. Pairwise FSTvalues and hierarchical AMOVA detected subtle but significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, mainly in samples of 2005 and some of 2006. However, Bayesian assignment analysis failed to detect genetic differentiation, which was also supported by the Mantel test and gene flow estimates among the sampled sites. This suggests that, despite the slight heterogeneity detected in this region, the dolphinfish forms a single panmictic population with high genetic variation and gene flow. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The interaction between ocean warming, hypoxia and hypercapnia, suggested by climate projections, may push an organism earlier to the limits of its thermal tolerance window. In a previous study on juveniles of green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), combined exposure to hypoxia and hypercapnia during heat stress induced a lowered critical thermal maximum (CTmax), indicated by constrained oxygen consumption, muscular spams and loss of attachment. Thus, the present study investigated the cell physiology in foot muscle of H. fulgens juveniles exposed to acute warming (18 °C to 32 °C at +3 °C day−1) under hypoxia (50% air saturation) and hypercapnia ($\sim$1000 $\mu$atm PCO2), alone and in combination, to decipher the mechanisms leading to functional loss in this tissue. Under exposure to either hypoxia or hypercapnia, citrate synthase (CS) activity decreased with initial warming, in line with thermal compensation, but returned to control levels at 32 °C. The anaerobic enzymes lactate and tauropine dehydrogenase increased only under hypoxia at 32 °C. Under the combined treatment, CS overcame thermal compensation and remained stable overall, indicating active mitochondrial regulation under these conditions. Limited accumulation of anaerobic metabolites indicates unchanged mode of energy production. In all treatments, upregulation of Hsp70 mRNA was observed already at 30 °C. However, lack of evidence for Hsp70 protein accumulation provides only limited support to thermal denaturation of proteins. We conclude that under combined hypoxia and hypercapnia, metabolic depression allowed the H. fulgens musculature to retain an aerobic mode of metabolism in response to warming but may have contributed to functional loss.},

abstract = {With ongoing climate change, rising ocean temperature is usually accompanied by falling oxygen levels (hy- poxia) and increasing CO2 concentration (hypercapnia). Both drivers may impose constraints on physiological mechanisms that define thermal limits resulting in increased vulnerability towards warming in marine ec- totherms. The present study aimed to detect differences in thermal tolerance by investigating the underlying metabolic responses in the green abalone (Haliotis fulgens) under conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia. Juvenile abalones were exposed to a temperature ramp (+3 °C day−1) under hypoxia (50% air saturation) and hypercapnia ($\sim$1000 $\mu$atm pCO2), both individually and in combination. Impacts on energy metabolism were assessed by analyzing whole animal respiration rates and metabolic profiles of gills and hepatopancreas via 1H NMR spectroscopy. While hypercapnia had a minor impact on the results of the temperature treatment, hypoxia strongly increased the vulnerability to warming, indicated by respiration rates falling below values expected from an exponential increase and by the onset of anaerobic metabolism suggesting a downward shift of the upper critical temperature. Warming under combined hypoxia and hypercapnia elicited a severe change in metabolism involving a strong accumulation of amino acids, osmolytes and anaerobic end products at intermediate tem- peratures, followed by declining concentrations at warmer temperatures. This matched the limited capacity to increase metabolic rate, loss of attachment and mortality observed under these conditions suggesting a strong narrowing of the thermal window. In all cases, the accumulation of free amino acids identified proteins as a significant energy source during warming stress. 1.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Along the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico), abalone represents one of the most lucrative fisheries. As wild populations are currently depleted, abalone farm production aims to balance the decreasing populations with the increasing demand. The Mexican abalone aquaculture is almost entirely based on red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). However, the increasing frequency of extreme temperature events is hampering this activity. The use interspecific hybrids can potentially improve abalone culture, as species have differences in their thermal tolerance. Therefore, the hybrid progeny between H. rufescens (♀) and pink abalone H. corrugata (♂), a temperate and a warmer water abalone species, respectively, will naturally support higher temperature. To test this hypothesis, growth rate, mortality and metabolic rate of both pure (RR) and hybrid abalone (RP) were assessed under the H. rufescens' optimum (18 °C) and thermally stressed (22 °C) conditions. To unveil the molecular pathways involved in the heat response, transcriptional profiling of both crosses was also investigated. At high temperature, we observed constrained growth and survival in RR while RP showed a significant increase in both rates, supporting the improved performance of the hybrid compared. These results match with the transcriptional profiling of hybrids showing higher expression of genes involved in growth and calcification, whereas in the pure red progeny, the transcriptional profile was mainly associated with the regulation of necroptosis process. Our results may contribute to propose new management plans to increase farm abalone production in Baja California.},
